# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


#   create a comment from rails console...#
#user = User.first
#post = Post.first
#comment = Comment.create!(description: "first comment", user: user, post: post)
#then do: 'post.comments' to see the post associated with the comment
#then do: 'user.comments' to see the user associated with the comment

#OR
#comment = post.comments.build(description: "another comment", user: user)
#comment.save, it will insert tino comments
